# mobileFirstResponsiveLayout2
 My Second Team Treehouse Project

 In this project, I will build my first mobile-first responsive layout, using responsive HTML and elaborite CSS. The initial CSS will be designed for a viewport width of 320px, but then I will add media queries (@media) for hypothetical viewport widths of 768px and 1024px.
